## REPL Commands

All commands start with `/`. Tab-completion is available for all of them.

### Conversation

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show all available commands |
| `/exit` | Save session summary and exit |
| `/clear` | Clear conversation (workspace/facts metadata preserved) |
| `/history [N]` | Show last N messages (default 10) |
| `/undo` | Remove last user + assistant message pair |
| `/export` | Export session as Markdown to `~/Downloads/` |

### Multi-line Input

End any line with `\` to continue on the next line:

```
You> Write a Python function that\
  ... takes a list and\
  ... returns only even numbers
```

The prompt switches to `  ...` while accumulating. Send a line without `\` to submit.

### Context & Memory

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/context` | Show token usage, context %, live message count |
| `/compact` | Manually compress conversation history now |
| `/memory` | List all stored facts |
| `/remember key: value` | Store a persistent fact |
| `/forget key` | Delete a stored fact |
| `/pin <text>` | Pin text into the system prompt — survives compression |
| `/pin` | List all pinned items |
| `/unpin <nr>` | Remove a pinned item by number |

**How `/pin` works:** Pinned text is injected as high-priority context into every system prompt, above the operational instructions. It is never compressed or lost.

### Agent & Tools

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/tools` | List all registered tools and their auto-approve status |
| `/autoapprove` | Toggle session-wide tool auto-approve (incl. sub-agents) |
| `/skills` | List installed YAML skills |

**Tool Approval Dialog:**

When the agent wants to execute a tool that requires approval, a dialog appears:

```
[1] Ausführen    [2] Abbrechen    [3] Bearbeiten    [4] Alle akzeptieren
```

| Choice | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `1` | Execute this tool call |
| `2` | Cancel this tool call |
| `3` | Edit the command before executing (shell tool only) |
| `4` | Auto-approve all remaining tool calls for this session (incl. sub-agents) |

**Sub-agent Tool Approval Dialog:**

```
[1] Ausführen    [2] Überspringen    [3] Bearbeiten    [4] Alle akzeptieren    [5] Abbrechen
```

| Choice | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `1` | Execute this tool call |
| `2` | Skip this tool call |
| `3` | Edit command |
| `4` | Auto-approve all remaining calls for this sub-agent run |
| `5` | Abort the entire sub-agent |

### Stats & Info

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/config` | Show current provider/model/personality settings |
| `/model` | Show current provider and model |
| `/cost` | Show token counts and estimated USD cost for this session |
| `/debug` | Toggle debug mode (shows extra context info) |

### Personality

|---------|-------------|
| `/skills` | List installed skills |
| `/<skillname> [args]` | Run a skill by its command name |

- **Context bar** — Each response shows token count and context usage percentage
- **Panels** — Responses wrapped in a styled panel with the agent's emoji and name
